# Exercises

### Try it with Movies App

As previously stated, this labs API is based on the [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction). As such, it should work with the solution to the Movies App you have developed in previous labs.

+ Run your solution to the last lab and, in ``getMovies()`` function in **tmdb_api.js**, replace the tmdb URL with the URL for your Mock API to get the list of movies. When the app reloads, you should see the list of 4 movies from the example:

## Other Endpoints

Have a look at what's missing in the current specification (e.g. schema and examples for the Genre endpoint) and other endpoints used by the Movies App. Using  [TMDB API](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) as a guide, add more features to the API.
