# API Docs

To make the API more useable, lets serve auto-generated swagger-ui generated API docs from the express application, based on the swagger.yaml file that's already in the repo from last weeks lab. The idea here is that this becomes a living document for your API hosted from your API server via it's own route route.

In order for this part to work, you will need to have completed part 6 of last weeks lab which created a *swagger.yaml* file in your repo. If not, please complete that part of the lab and do  ``git pull`` in your local repository (or else retrieve it from [https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/fxwalsh/MovieeAPI/1.0#/info]). Your file structure in *ewd-api-labs-2021* should look as follows:

![Files](./img/files.png)

- Install **Swagger UI Express** and **js-yaml** in the *node-lab1* folder

 ~~~bash
 npm install swagger-ui-express js-yaml --save
 ~~~

- **In the node-lab1 folder**, open the entry point script, *index.js*, and add the following to the import declarations. 

~~~javascript
import swaggerUi from 'swagger-ui-express';
import yaml from 'js-yaml';
import fs from 'fs';
~~~

- Add the following line of code to load the Swagger Document

~~~javascript
const swaggerDocument = yaml.load(fs.readFileSync('./../movie-api-yaml/swagger.yaml', 'utf8'));
~~~

- Finally add the documents route to the app.

~~~javascript
app.use('/api/docs', swaggerUi.serve, swaggerUi.setup(swaggerDocument));
~~~

- In a browser, request [http://localhost:8080/api/docs/]. You should see the generated documentation for the API.
