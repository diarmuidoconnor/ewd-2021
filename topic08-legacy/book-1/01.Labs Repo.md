# Labs Repository

You already are using Git/Github for your work with React. You will now create a new repo for your Web API work and use it with a Dev Container to develop the API labs.  

### Create a Remote Repository

- Go to github.com, log in, and click the '+' in the top right to create a new repository.
  Give it a name ***ewd-api-labs-2023**, and a short description.
  Select the following options:
  - make it public or private as you see fit.

  - Create a ***readme.md*.**
  - create a ***.gitignore*** and select the ***Node*** option in the dropdown.

Click create repository and you should be taken to your new repo page. 

- Copy the repo URL from the "Code" option on the repo page.  You will need the URL of the repo to clone this repo to your local machine.

### Clone your Remote to your Local Machine

- On your local machine, find a suitable folder and clone your remote repo

~~~bash
$ git clone <YOUR_URL_FROM_GITHUB>
~~~

**Make sure you have a ``.gitignore`` file that ignores node-based things that you don't want to track, such as ``.env``, ``node-modules``.**
