# Examples

As with the schemas, we can create an examples property inside the components property of the API specification. 

### Movie List

You will provide an example response for the **get: /api/movies**  endpoint. For now, we will use a list of just 4 movies as an example. 

- At the bottom of the ``components:`` property, add the following example responses for the GET and POST request for the **/api/movies** path. Make sure to indent  ``examples:`` correctly or you'll get an error: 

~~~yaml

- Now update the `200` response for the  ``/api/movies/`` path to include a reference to this example. Add the new lines indicated by the YAML comment in below example. The `200` property of the responses should look like the following:

~~~yaml
        '200':
          description: 'List of Movies'
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                 $ref: '#/components/schemas/MovieList'
              examples:  # ADD NEW CODE  FROM HERE ON
                objectExample:
                  $ref: '#/components/examples/MovieList' 
~~~

+ Now check the API description on the right of the screen. You should see the example included:  

  ![Movies List](.\img\movies.png)



We'll put more examples in for the other endpoints later. For now, continue to the next section.
