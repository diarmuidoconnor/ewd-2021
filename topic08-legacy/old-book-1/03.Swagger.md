# Swagger

Swagger is a free and open source framework you can use to define a standard, language-agnostic interface to a REST API. The definition, written to the openapi 3.0 standard, allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service.

## SwaggerHub

Using SwaggerHub,  you can define and manage your APIs using the OpenAPI Specification. It integrates the core Swagger tools into a single platform to help you coordinate the entire workflow of an APIâ€™s lifecycle (with no download/install!).

- Go to https://swagger.io/tools/swaggerhub/ and select the "Sign up free" option.
- Sign up using your github credentials.

## Initial Simple API

You are going to design a simple Movie API that provides for the following:

> List Movies  
> Get a Movie's details  
> Get Genres  
> Get Movie Reviews  
> Add a Movie Review

This can be mapped to the following API description:

![Simple Movie API](./img/api.png)

## SwaggerHub API Description

- In SwaggerHub, click on the Create New -> Create New API.

![Create New API](./img/create.png)

- Create a Blank API with the following configuration:

![Create New API Template](./img/spec.png)

You should now see a blank YAML template similar to the following. 

![Initial Template](./img/initial-template.png)

## Path: - /api/movie 

Initially, we will update the template to describe the ``GET`` operation for ``/api/movies``. We will define responses for two HTTP statuses, 200 (all OK), 401 (not Authorised, 404 (Not found) and 500 (something went wrong!).

- In the **paths:** property of the API description, replace the curly braces and add the **/api/movies** path:

~~~yaml
paths: 
  /api/movies:
    get:
      operationId: list-movies
      summary: List Movies
      description: List movies from movie db.
      tags:
        - movies
      responses:
        '200':
          description: 'List of Movies'
        '401':
          description: 'Unauthorised'
        '404':
          description: "Not Found"
        '5XX':
          description: "Server Error"
~~~

Swaggerhub will parse and validate the API description as you modify it. If you see any errors (indicated by red 'x's), please read the error message and attempt to resolve it. If there are any error, you will not be able to test the API. 

Click on the Save Button to save the file. 

## Path: - /api/genre

Using the ``get: /api/movies/`` endpoint as a reference, and using class resources/examples, create the entry for ``api/genres``.

## Path: - /api/movie/{id}

Now you will add path for accessing specific movies. Each movie will have a unique ID, which is contained in the URL (/api/movies/{id}). This is known as a parameterised URL:

- Add the following code to the ``path:`` property of the API definition. Make sure the 

~~~yaml
  /api/movies/{id}:
    get:
      operationId: get-a-movie
      summary: Get a movie
      description: Get a movie using the Movie ID
      tags:
        - movies
      parameters:
        - in: path
          name: id
          schema:
            type: integer
          required: true
          description: Unique ID of the movie
      responses:
        '200':
          description: 'Movie details'
        '401':
          description: 'Unauthorised'
        '404':
          description: "Not found"
        '5XX':
          description: "Server Error"
~~~

The above code defines the **HTTP GET: /api/movies** endpoint for Movie details using movie **``id``**. The parameter is indicated using curly braces in the path (i.e. {id}. Notice that  ``parameters:``  is used to explicitly define the ``id`` parameter.
If this validates, you should see the path appear in in the MovieDB API description to the right of editor. 

## Path: /api/movie/{id}/reviews

For this path, you need to describe both **get** and **post** operations (two endpoints) for the getting a list of reviews and adding a review respectively:

- Add the following path to the file:

~~~yaml
  /api/movies/{id}/reviews:
      get:
        operationId: get-movie-reviews
        summary: Get a movie's reviews
        description: Get a movie's reviews
        tags:
        	- movies
        parameters:
          - in: path
            name: id
            schema:
              type: integer
            required: true
            description: Unique ID of the movie to get
        responses:
          '200':
            description: 'Movie reviews'
          '401':
            description: 'Unauthorised'
          '404':
            description: "Not found"
          '5XX':
            description: "Server Error"
      post:
        operationId: post-movie-reviews
        summary: Post a movie reviews
        description: Post a movie reviews
        tags:
        	- movies
        parameters:
          - in: path
            name: id
            schema:
              type: integer
            required: true
            description: Unique ID of the movie
        responses:
          '201':
            description: 'Movie Review Added'
          '401':
            description: 'Unauthorised'
          '404':
            description: "Not found"
          '5XX':
            description: "Server Error"
~~~

You should now have a API description on the left that looks as follows:
