# Swaggerhub Auto Mocking

Swaggerhub provides a public URL to test your API. This is useful to check the API performs as expected or allow front end developers to start working with the API. You'll notice the API description has a SwaggerHub API  Mocking URL. You can test against this URL from within SwaggerHub by clicking on the "Try it out" button. This will generate a HTTP request based on the path description:

- Click on the the "MovieAPI" to open the details of the api. Select "Integrations" and run the **Mock API** integration.

-In the **API Description** on the left, click/expand ``/api/movies``. Click on the "Try it Out" button followed by execute.  Check the response is correct (i.e. 200 and Movie Details). You should see something similar to the following:

![Mock Server - Swaggerhub](./img/mock1.png)

As it's a simple HTTP GET, you can also check out the response in a separate browser window:

- Copy and paste the request URL into the browser address field. You should see a valid response as before:

# GitHub Sync

GitHub Sync allows you to synchronize your API definition with an existing repository on GitHub. The synchronization is done every time you save the API in SwaggerHub.  you are also able to configure which files to add, update, or ignore in the target repository.


- Click the API name, switch to the Integrations tab, and click Add New Integrations:

![Integrations](./img/integ.png)

- Select **GitHub Sync** from the list of integrations.

- In the following dialog, specify the name as shown below and click Connect to GitHub. If it's ok with you, allow SwaggerHub to retrieve information from your GitHub account when requested

You will now be prompted to configure your GitHub Sync. Configure it to do the following:

- Select the repository you created earlier in the lab (**ewd-api-labs-2021**)
- Select **Advanced Sync**
- Enter **main**  for branch 
- Select **YAML (Resolved)** for Generated API code
- Enter **movie-api-yaml** for Output Folder
- Add a partially Managed Path and enter **\*** (wildcard). This will allow Swaggerhub to update repo but not overwrite existing files.

See the following image for guidance on the last few fields:

- Finally, hit Create and Execute to sync with GitHub. Check out the repo on GitHub - it should have the API definition:

![Synced Repo](./img/repo1.png)

- Now do a **git pull** on ewd-api-labs-2021. You should see the synced folder in the rep containing the API definition.
