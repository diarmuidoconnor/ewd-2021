# Exercises



There are other features we could include to improve the security of our API. Take a look at the following and include in your App. This is an optional exercise but, if included in your assignment submission, will gain you marks!

## Additional Security  middleware

Here are some modules that can help you secure your API.

```
$ npm install --save helmet hpp csurf express-rate-limit
```

**[helmet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/helmet) ** This sets various HTTP headers that can help defend against common web app security vulnerabilities, such as xss attacks.

+ Install and place on your middleware stack. 

**[hpp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hpp) ** This protects against HTTP Parameter Pollution attacks

+ Install and place on your middleware stack. 



## HTTPS

If you captured the HTTP traffic in and out of your API at the moment (using a network analyser like [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/)), you would be able to see the data contained in each request. **HTTPS** is HTTP with a layer of encryption,  creating a secure channel over an insecure network. In HTTPS, communication  is encrypted using the cryptographic protocol  Transport Layer Security (TLS). You'll probably notice that most web sites use HTTPS.

With Express and Node, itâ€™s not difficult to make your API compatible with https because it includes a https module. 

To do HTTPS, you need a SSL certificate and a private key. The certificate allows users to identify that they are talking to the right server. The privet key allows the server to decrypt the messages sent to it.

Typically, in a production systems, you would use a public *Certificate Authority (CA)* for issuing digital certificates (such as Comodo, GoDaddy, DigiCert and GlobalSign).  However, for development purposes, you can be your own CA!



### Creating Keys and Certificates

Depending on your OS, there are different ways to create your own SSL certs. As you already have Git, it comes with openssl so you can use this. The location of the executable on a default windows installation is : "C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\openssl.exe". It will be different on MAC. If you have Linux, you can just use *openssl*  command instead of *"C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\openssl.exe"*.

+ Use OpenSSL to create Keys and Certificates:

  ~~~bash
  "C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\openssl.exe" req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout keytmp.pem -out cert.pem -days 365
  ~~~

 You'll be asked for identification data for the subject of the signing request. Fill in as needed and use a memorable password

+ Now get a decrypted key. The server will need this to decrypt incoming requests:

  ~~~bash
  "C:\Program Files\Git\usr\bin\openssl.exe" rsa -in keytmp.pem -out key.pem
  ~~~

### Include key/certificate in Express API

Once you have generated the keys and certificate, we need to include it in our express app and start a https server with it.

+ Copy the generated files ``key.pem`` and ``cert.pem`` to the root of your Express app (in the same folder as the entry point, index.js)

+ Open the .env file and add the following SSL Port:

  ~~~javascript
  SSL_PORT=3443
  ~~~

  

+ Update  the entry point, index.js, with the following code:

~~~javascript
import https from 'https';

// Other Code exactly as before 

const key = fs.readFileSync('./key.pem');
const cert = fs.readFileSync('./cert.pem');
const sslPort = process.env.SSL_PORT;
const server = https.createServer({key: key, cert: cert }, app);

server.listen(sslPort,() => {
  console.info(`HTTPS Server running at ${sslPort}`);
});


~~~

Now test the endpoints as before, this time using ``https://...`  and port 3443 in the URL. You will get a warning about using a Self Signed Cert, but you can ignore that for now. In reality/production, you would use a trusted authority.
