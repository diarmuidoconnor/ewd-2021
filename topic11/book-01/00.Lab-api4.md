# Authentication using JWT and Passport

This lab implements a JWT-based Authentication strategy on the MovieDB API solution from the previous lab.

This lab will create authentication with JSON Web Tokens for the MovieDB API solution in previous labs. You will include the jwt token with every request, meaning that we donâ€™t need sessions. Clients of the service will need to save the JWT in localStorage or other places on the frontend.

In this lab you will:

+ Update the MovieDB React app to use the API.
+ Update the */api/users* route to register and acquire a token
+ Add authorisation middleware the *api/movies* route, making it only is available to users with a valid JSON web token
+ Add basic login/signin functionality to MovieDB React app.
