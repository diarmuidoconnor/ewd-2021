# React - API Integration

You will use a simple React App and integrate it with the API. You can get this application from the Resources archive in this topic on the website.

This React App is taken from the code samples from the  **Navigation and App Design** React topic. 

## Initial set up

+ Download the React App archive from the Resources link on the website.
+ Create a folder called **reactApp** in the root of your labs git repository and extract the archive into it.  DO NOT EXTRACT THIS INTO *lab-node-3* FOLDER FOR YOUR OTHER LABS. Your reactApp folder should look like this:  
  ![reactApp folder contents](.\img\7.png)

+ Open a terminal Window in the *reactApp* folder and run ``npm install`` followed by ``npm start``. This should start the React app and you should see the App appear in the browser  
  ![Simple React App](.\img\1.png)

In this application, the *Movies* and *Profile* routes are protected. 

+ Click on the *movies* link you'll see that the Login Page is shown. 
+ Click on the *LogIn* button and it will Authenticate you, allowing access to the protected groups.

Look at the code and notice that there is a *pages.js* that exports most of the  pages for the app and the *authContext.js* provides the authentication context for all pages.



We will now connect theReact App to the movie API. 

## System Architecture

The **create-react-app** provides a mechanism for working with an API server in development. We can make the development server proxy requests intended for our API server as follows:

![Development Architecture](./img/2.png)

The React app makes an API request to localhost:3000, the **Webpack** development server. The development server then proxies that request to the API server. This will remove any Cross-Origin-Resource-Sharing (CORS) issues with the browser.
You will now configure react dev server to proxy requests to the Express API.

#### Proxy Server
To have the React development server proxy our API requests to our Express API server, we need to add the following to the **package.json file for the React Application**

+ In the *ReactApp* folder, open *package.json* and add the following property just before the closing brace (``}``): 

```json
,"proxy":"http://localhost:8080"
```

Make sure the format of the *package.json* is correct/valid before you try to start the app.

This should now forward any request for unknown resources to the Express API listening on port 8080.

+ **RESTART THE REACT APP**.

## Integrating the Express Movie API

Currently the simple React app uses no API to authenticate or retrieve movies. You will now add the functionality that integrates the express API.  You also need to manage JWT tokens in local storage in the browser.

Initially, we will integrate the authentication functionality.

+ Go to the */src * folder and create a new folder called *api*
+ In  */src/api/*, create a new file called *movie-api.js* with the following code:

```javascript
export const login = async (username, password) => {
    const res = await fetch('/api/users', {
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        method: 'post',
        body: JSON.stringify({ username: username, password: password })
    })
    return res.json();
};

export const signup = async (username, password) => {
    const res = await fetch('/api/users?action=register', {
        headers: {
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        },
        method: 'post',
        body: JSON.stringify({ username: username, password: password })
    })
    return res.json();
};

```

Notice how the routes match what is implemented in the Express API **and** what you tested using postman. The proxy property in the React *package.json* provides the host information required to complete the request(i.e. localhast:8080).
