# Serverless REST API.

In the previous lab, we developed a simple serverless app where each lambda function had a unique URL.

The Gateway allows us to define a REST interface to the backend using serverless technology. The diagram below shows our target infrastructure:

### Setup.

Download and unzip [this archive][start]. It's the solution to the previous lab with minor filename changes, e.g. lib/simple-app.ts renamed lib/rest-api-stack.ts. Import it into VS Code and type the commands
~~~bash
$ npm install
Â£ cdk deploy
~~~
Check Cloudformation for the new stack:

In GitHub, create a new repository called 'ewd-serverless-lab'. In VS Code, make this a remote repository using the command:
~~~bash
$ git remote add origin [your repo URL]
