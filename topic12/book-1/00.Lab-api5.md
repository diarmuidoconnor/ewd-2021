# API Testing Lab

This lab shows you how to test a Node API using Postman and Newman.

Tests confirm that your API is working as expected, that integrations between services are functioning reliably, and that new developments haven't broken any existing functionality. 

## Prerequisites

You need a working version of the Movies API for this lab. The solution to the last lab you completed will suffice.
