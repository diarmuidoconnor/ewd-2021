# Unit Testing Mongoose Models

Ideally, for unit testing, you would like to test without having to connect to a database. Unit-testing is where we test one single unit at a time in isolation from other functionalities. A DB connection would make the tests slow, difficult to set up, and really would become a form of integration testing because we would be testing database integration code as part of the test.

To demonstrate unit testing of our models for MovieDB (in this case userModel) we will use the **Mocha.js** test framework. We will use **should.js** as the assertion mechanism to write the tests and finally **signon.js** to spy on and check correct function calls.

## Unit Testing - User Model

Our Mongoose models include instance and static methods. We would like to write some tests for them however, some instance methods access the database and, ideally, we'd like to remove db dependencies for unit tests. This is a bit more challenging but we can use **sinon.js** to check that we are calling the db  correctly.

+ As we are testing 

+ Create a *tests* folder in */api/users* and create a file called *.eslintrc* that contains the following:

~~~json
{
    "env": {
        "mocha": true
    },
    "rules": {
       "no-unused-vars":"off"
    }
}
~~~

This stops linting (if you're using it) complaining about unused variables in your tests which happen due to testing pattern used by "Should".

+ In */api/users/tests*, create  file called *testUserSchema.js* and add the following simple tests:

~~~javascript
import should from 'should';
import userModel from '../userModel';

describe('userModelTests', () => {
    const testUser = {};
    const badUser = {};
    before(()=>{
        //valid user object
        testUser.username = "fxwalsh";
        testUser.password = "pass";
        //invalid user object
        badUser.name="dodgy";
        badUser.pass="dodgypass";

    });

    it('should validate a user with a username and password', (done) => {   
        const m = new userModel(testUser);
        m.validate((err) => {
           should.not.exist(err);
           m.username.should.equal(testUser.username);
           m.password.should.equal(testUser.password);
           done();
        });
    });
})
~~~

+ In the root folder of the Express app, open *package.json* and, in the ``scripts`` property, add a new entry to run the mocha using the tests defined in the */api/* folders:

~~~json
...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "cross-env NODE_ENV=development nodemon --exec babel-node index.js",
    "unit-test": "cross-env NODE_ENV=test mocha ./api/**/tests/*.js --require babel-core/register --require babel-polyfill --exit"
  },
...
~~~


+ Open a command line at the root of the Express node app and  run the test by entering ``npm run unit-test``. You should see output similar to the following:

   ![Unit Test - postModel](./img/unit1.png)

## More tests...

+ Now add the following to check user validation. In this test use the ``badUser`` object. This is missing required properties *userName* and *password* so should create an ``err`` object.


~~~javascript
    it('should require a username and password', (done) => {
        const m = new userModel(badUser);
        m.validate((err) => {
           should.exist(err);
           const errors = err.errors;
           errors.should.have.property("username");
           errors.should.have.property("password");
           done();
        });
~~~

based on the validation specified in the userModel, both username and password should be present in the error object.

+ Run ``npm run unit-test`` again. You should now see 2 successful tests

## Testing User Schema Static Methods - findByUserName

We would like to test the ``findByUserName`` method. However, this requires a connection to a MongoDB as is uses the ``findOne`` function provided by Mongoose model to query the DB. The point of this test is to test the code, not the DB connection and ,ideally , the test should work in isolation from the DB. Here we can use **Sinon** to stub out the DB related function ``findOne``,and just check that it is called correctly.

+ Add the following to the import section of testUserModel

~~~javascript
import sinon from 'sinon';
import sinonTestFactory from 'sinon-test';

const sinonTest = sinonTestFactory(sinon);
~~~

+ Now, in the same file, add the following test:

~~~javascript
        it('should search using username', sinonTest(function () {
        this.stub(userModel, 'findOne');
        userModel.findByUserName(testUser.username);
        sinon.assert.calledWith(userModel.findOne, {
            username: testUser.username
        });
    }));
~~~

We start by stubbing ``userModel.findOne``. We "stub it out" so it doesnâ€™t do any database access. Stubbing it also allows us to use **Sinon.js** to check whether it was called with the correct parameters.

We then call ``userModel.findByUserName(username)`` and use ``sinon.assert.calledWith...`` to check the stubbed ``findOne`` was called correctly.

+ Run the tests as before using ``npm run unit-test``. You should now have 3 passing tests:

![unit Tests - User Model](./img/unit3.png)

## Testing User Schema instance Methods - comparePasswords

As the ``comparePasswords`` method does not directly "go at" the database, it can be checked without stubbing.

+ Insert the following test into the same file as above,  *testUserSchema.js*.

~~~javascript
   it('should detect matching passwords', (done) => {

        const username = "fxwalsh";
        const password = "$2a$10$hxklBTD1KLdYOCrulbtf8OKxjxFEc5WBCODCCCYGb67udslRc0mHi";

        const user1 = {
            username: username,
            password: password
        };

        const user2 = {
            username: username,
            password: password
        };

        const m1 = new userModel(user1);
        const m2 = new userModel(user2);

        m1.comparePassword(m2.password, (err, result) => {
                should.not.exist(err);
                result.should.be.true;
                done();
            }


        )
    });
~~~

The above test creates 2 users with the same password. The ``comparePassword`` method is called and resulting callback validated the correct response(no ``err`` object and ``result==true``).
