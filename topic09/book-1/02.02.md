# Movies 

Lets now refactor the movies endpoints so that they conform to the  structure we've applied to accounts. We also want to integrate to the TMDB api to provide main source of movie data. For this we will use [axios](https://axios-http.com/), a HTTP client module.  

## Update .env 

You will need to include the TMDB api key you used in previous labs. 

+ Add your TMDBkey to  your ***.env*** file as follows: 
  ```TMDB_KEY=YOUR_TBDM_KEY```

+ Import **axios** as a dependency. Enter the following on the command line:
  ~~~
  npm install -save axios
  ~~~

Axios is a HTTP client module that we will use to make requests to the TMDB API.

## Folder structure

+ Inside the folder ***src/movies***, create the same folder structure as you did in the accounts folder.

  We won't use all of these folders yet. 
  
+ In the ***src/movies/services*** folder, create a file called ***index.js*** add the following code:

~~~javascript
import axios from 'axios';

export default {
    getMovie: async (movieId) => {
        const response = await axios.get(
            `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/${movieId}?api_key=${process.env.TMDB_KEY}`
          );
          return response.data;
    },
    find: async (query) => {
        const response = await axios.get(
            `https://api.themoviedb.org/3/discover/movie?api_key=${process.env.TMDB_KEY}&language=en-US&include_adult=false&include_video=false&${query}`
          );
          return response.data;
    },

  };
~~~



+ In the ***src/movies/controllers*** folder, create a file called ***index.js*** add the following code:

  ~~~javascript
  import moviesService from "./../services";
  
  export default (dependencies) => {
  
      const getMovie = async (request, response, next) => {
          //input
          const movieId = request.params.id;
          // Treatment
          const movie = await moviesService.getMovie(movieId, dependencies);
          //output
          response.status(200).json(movie);
      };
      const find = async (request, response, next) => {
          //input
          const query = request.query;
          // Treatment
          const accounts = await moviesService.find(query, dependencies);
          //output
          response.status(200).json(accounts);
      };
  
      return {
          getMovie,
          find
      };
  };
  ~~~

+ In the ***src/movies/routes*** folder, create a file called ***index.js*** add the following code:

  ~~~javascript
  import express from 'express';
  import MoviesController from '../controllers';
  
  const createMoviesRouter = (dependencies) => {
      const router = express.Router();
      // load controllers with dependencies
      const moviesController = MoviesController(dependencies);
  
      router.route('/:id')
          .get(moviesController.getMovie);
  
      router.route('/')
          .get(moviesController.find);
  
      return router;
  };
  export default createMoviesRouter;
  ~~~

## Update index.js

Now we need to change the routing for the ***'api/movies'*** path in the app entry script.

+ Open the api entry point,  ***index.js*** , in the root folder and add the following to import the new movies router:

  ~~~java
  import createMoviesRouter from './src/movies/routes';
  //.....existing code
  ~~~

+ You can remove the previous import statement for the movies router from last week.

+ **Replace the existing line of code** that adds the movies router to the following:

  ~~~javascript
  app.use('/api/movies', createMoviesRouter(dependencies));
  ~~~



## Test It!

+ As with the Accounts endpoints, test that your implementation has worked. It should return Movie data from the TMBD api.
