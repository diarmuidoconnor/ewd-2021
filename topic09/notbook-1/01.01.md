# Set up

We will continue to develop an API for the MovieDB that will be able to drive the React App you completed in the labs. 
To speed up the process and align more closely to the MovieDB API and the React App from previous labs, download the **starter code archive for this topic** and extract it into your **ewd-api-labs-2021** repo you created in the last lab. If you need to, rename/reorganise your folder so that the express app is in "**node_lab2**" folder in **ewd-api-labs-2021**.

- Run ``npm install`` followed by ``npm start`` to check it launches successfully(if you have not completed the previous lab, you may have to create a Swagger document in "../movie-api-yaml/swagger.yaml").

- Use Postman to check a few of the endpoints:

Once it's up and running, we can now add a User to the API and persist using MongoDB and Mongoose

## MongoDB Setup

![Mongoose](./img/download.png)

You can need to create a MongoDB in one of two forms: Installed Locally or Cloud-based. This lab was developed using Mongo on the locally as per the following instructions: 

### Local MongoDB

If you want to use a local db running on your laptop, do the following:

+ Download and install MongoDB by selecting the relevant installer for your OS: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community

Follow the instructions and accept all defaults.

This should create and start the Mongodb service on your local host.



### **OPTIONAL ALTERNATIVE TO LOCAL DB:** Mongo Cloud

**THIS IS OPTIONAL. If you would prefer to use a cloud db, do this step:**. 

You can also use Mongo DB as a service if you wish.  This will allow you to use MongDB as a *cloud database* system without having to install MongoDB database on your local machine. 

- Go to  https://cloud.mongodb.com/

- create a free tier cluster in Amazon Ireland Region. *Follow the instructions for a free tier **
- Make sure to follow all the steps to create the cluster. Once complete, get the connection string for your MongoDB as shown below:

- It is risky to have configuration parameters such as user-names, passwords, and instance specific parameters "hard coded" into your javascript programs. In this exercise you will externalise these parameters into the ".env" file. Add the **mongoDb connection string** to the end of your ``.env`` file in the root folder of the express app. 

```bash
mongoDB=mongodb+srv://....
```
