## Update Storybook.

The storybook stories we wrote in part 1 of this series no longer work due to refactoring and enhancements made to the components in subsequent labs. Confir this by starting the Storybook server:
~~~
$ npm run storybook
~~~
A typical error is illustrated below:

![][storieserror]

To fix the errors, download [this archive][stories], unzip it and copy each of the files into your `src/stories` folder - you are overwriting your current story files. Refresh the Storybook UI in the browser. All the stories should now render correctly.

The critical differences in the updated story implementations are as follows:

1. Often a component must be composed with another to work correctly. A typical example is Context Providers. In Storybook, we *add a Decorator* to the story to satisfy these requirements. A decorator wraps a story's component inside another component. 
1. Any component that uses the Link component needs to be wrapped inside a Router component. The BrowserRouter component served this purpose in our app. In Storybook, we can use MemoryRouter, which is more lightweight.
1. Components that use react-query must be composed with the QueryClient provider.


Review the updated story files. For example, the stories for the MovieDetails component (in `src/stories/movieDetails.stories.js`) needed the MemoryRouter and MoviesContextProvider as decorators:

~~~
export default {
  title: "Movie Details Page/MovieDetails",
  component: MovieDetails,
  decorators: [
    (Story) => <MemoryRouter initialEntries={["/"]}>{Story()}</MemoryRouter>,
    (Story) => <MoviesContextProvider>{Story()}</MoviesContextProvider>,
  ],
};

export const Basic = () => <MovieDetails movie={SampleMovie} />;
Basic.storyName = "Default";
~~~
