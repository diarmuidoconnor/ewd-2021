# Load Data

While developing and testing the API, it would be good to 'seed' the DB with data when the app starts. This will help with development and testing of functionality as we go forward (it would be switched off/removed for production of course) 
Include a ``seedDb`` property in *.env* file to indicate if we wish to seed the database with data.

```bash
seedDb=true
```

+ Locate the folder called *seedData* in the root folder of the Express app(**node-lab2**).
+ In the *seedData* folder, create a new file called ``index.js``  and enter the following code:

```javascript
import userModel from '../api/users/userModel';
import movieModel from '../api/movies/movieModel';
import { movies } from './movies';
import { users } from './users';

// deletes all user documents in collection and inserts test data
async function loadUsers() {
  console.log('load user Data');
  try {

    await userModel.deleteMany();
    await userModel.collection.insertMany(users);
    console.info(`${users.length} users were successfully stored.`);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`failed to Load user Data: ${err}`);
  }
}

// deletes all movies documents in collection and inserts test data
async function loadMovies() {
  try {
    await movieModel.deleteMany();
    await movieModel.collection.insertMany(movies);
    console.info(`${movies.length} Movies were successfully stored.`);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error(`failed to Load movie Data: ${err}`);
  }
}

if (process.env.seedDb) {
  loadUsers();
  loadMovies();
}
```

The ``loadUsers()`` and ``loadMovies()`` functions in the above script will initialise the database with the users and movie data we used in the previous labs.  
**NOTE:** we are using  **Async Await** syntax for asynchronous programming in the above code:. For more info see :https://medium.com/better-programming/understanding-async-await-in-javascript-1d81bb079b2c

+ Add the following code to the imports in ``index.js`` in the root folder(**node-lab2**) of your Express app. NOTE: make sure it 

```javascript
import './seedData';
....
```

All going well, when the server restarts it should report the successful insertion of User and Movie data into your MongoDB:

If you wish, you can check everything worked using Mongo Compass. You should see 2 collections, users and  Movies, with the inserted documents.
