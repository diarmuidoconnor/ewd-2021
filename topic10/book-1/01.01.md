# Set up

We will continue to develop an API for the MovieDB that will be able to drive the React App you completed in the labs. We will use last weeks lab as a starting point. 


- Start last weeks lab. Use Postman to check a few of the endpoints from last weeks lab:

![Get Movies](./img/movies1.png)

![Get a Movies](./img/movies2.png)

Once it's up and running, we can now add a User to the API and persist using MongoDB and Mongoose

## Getting Mongo

![Mongoose](./img/download.png)

You need to create a MongoDB service for your API. We will do this using another Docker Container and Docker Compose to combine it with our work so far to create a multi-container environment. 
To do this, we will take a pre-existing template for a Node-Mongo environment: https://github.com/devcontainers/templates/tree/main/src/javascript-node-mongo

Place the following files in your .devcontainer folder in your lab

### DockerFile

+ In the folder ``.devcontainer``, create a new file called "DockerFile" with the following content.



~~~dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/devcontainers/javascript-node:0-18

# Install MongoDB command line tools - though mongo-database-tools not available on arm64
ARG MONGO_TOOLS_VERSION=6.0
RUN . /etc/os-release \
    && curl -sSL "https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-${MONGO_TOOLS_VERSION}.asc" | gpg --dearmor > /usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-archive-keyring.gpg \
    && echo "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/mongodb-archive-keyring.gpg] http://repo.mongodb.org/apt/debian ${VERSION_CODENAME}/mongodb-org/${MONGO_TOOLS_VERSION} main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-${MONGO_TOOLS_VERSION}.list \
    && apt-get update && export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive \
    && apt-get install -y mongodb-mongosh \
    && if [ "$(dpkg --print-architecture)" = "amd64" ]; then apt-get install -y mongodb-database-tools; fi \
    && apt-get clean -y && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

ENV DEVCONTAINER=true
~~~

This uses the same base container as the previous lab. We also need to add some Mongo command Line tools in the App container. This will allow us to check the DB from VS Code.

### DockerCompose

Docker Compose allows us to "compose" two different containers; one for the express app and another for the MongoDB. 

+ In the folder ``.devcontainer``, create a new file called "docker-compose.yml" with the following content.

~~~dockerfile
version: '3.8'

services:
  app:
    build: 
      context: .
      dockerfile: DockerFile
    volumes:
      - ../..:/workspaces:cached

    # Overrides default command so things don't shut down after the process ends.
    command: sleep infinity

    # Runs app on the same network as the database container, allows "forwardPorts" in devcontainer.json function.
    network_mode: service:db


  db:
    image: mongo:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - mongodb-data:/data/db

volumes:
  mongodb-data:
~~~



### devcontainer.json

+ In the folder ``.devcontainer``, replace the contents of  "devcontainer.json" with the following content.

~~~dockerfile
{
	"name": "ewd-labs",
	"dockerComposeFile": "docker-compose.yml",
	"service": "app",
	"workspaceFolder": "/workspaces/${localWorkspaceFolderBasename}",

	// Configure tool-specific properties.
	"customizations": {
		// Configure properties specific to VS Code.
		"vscode": {
			// Add the IDs of extensions you want installed when the container is created.
			"extensions": [
				"mongodb.mongodb-vscode"
			]
		}
	}
}
~~~

Rebuild your Codespace now. You should see it build with both containers available
