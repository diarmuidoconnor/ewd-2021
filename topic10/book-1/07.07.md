2. Improve the validation provided in the lab as follows:
   1. The firstname and lastname have a minimum length of 1 and a maximum length of 20.
   2. The password length should be at least 7 and contain a number and special character. You can use the following regex to do this: 
      `**^(?=.\*[0-9])(?=.\*[a-z])(?=.\*[A-Z])(?=.\*[@#$%^&-+=()])(?=\\S+$).{7, 20}$**`
