# Exercises



1. Improve the validation provided in the lab as follows:

   + The firstname and lastname have a minimum length of 1 and a maximum length of 30.

   + The password length should be at least 7, maximum 20,  and contain at least one alpha character, number and special character. You can use the following regex to do this: 
     `**^(?=.\*[0-9])(?=.\*[a-z])(?=.\*[A-Z])(?=.\*[@#$%^&-+=()])(?=\\S+$).{7, 20}$**`

2. The add favourites endpoint allows duplicate entries. You should not be able to add the same movie more than once. Implement code that checks for duplicates in the favourites array before adding it.

   **OPTIONAL:** 

3. Implement the GET Genres endpoint using Mongo/Mongoose. You can create a genres collection in MongoDB and load  Genres data from lab 1.
   This will take time as you should try to implement the same architecture and directory structure for accounts - i.e. create a Genre Repository,  Genre Entity class, Genre  Service, etc.
