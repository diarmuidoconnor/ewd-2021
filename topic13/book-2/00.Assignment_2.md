# Assignment 2 specification.

## Overview.

__Objective:__ Demonstrate your knowledge of API's, Express, Mongoose, Authentication by developing an API and integrate it with your React app from Assignment 1.The app may extend the Movies API developed in the labs (preference) or a bespoke app (subject to approval).

Completion: 22/05/2023.

Weight: 50%.

Deliverables:
A text file (assignment2.txt) containing:

+ The URL of your source code GitHub repo.
     + With a completed README.md (see provided template).
+ The URL of your YouTube video demonstrating your API.
    + We may follow up with a Zoom meeting for Q and A (if required).

##### The README is the documentation of the work you have carried out and must be complete and accurate. We will provide a template later.

##### You must maintain a detailed Git commit history throughout the assignment period. We advise that you commit at every development session - the 'only commit working code' principle need not always apply. Commit messages must always explain the purpose of each session, whether achieved or not.
