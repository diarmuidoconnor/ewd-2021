## Repeat exam - Serverless Web APIs.

Please use the Serverless REST API repository provided prior to this exam as the starting code for your answer to the questions below.

Duration: 45 minutes

-------------------------------

### Question 1.
__You are required__ to add a new endpoint to the REST API, defined as follows:

+ GET  /crew/{role}/movies/{movieId} - Get  the name(s) of crew members who performed a specific role for a specific movie, e.g. GET  /crew/director/movies/1234 - get the director(s) for movie 1234.

#### After completing the above implementation, commit the changes using the commit message "Added new endpoint" and push the commit to your GitHub repository.

### Question 2.

Amend your solution to question 1 to allow a request to specify a name substring, as follows:
+ GET  /crew/{role}/movies/{movieId}?name=subString - return the name(s) only if it contains subString within it, e.g. GET /crew/director/movies/1234?name=Blog - return the name(s) only if the director of movie 1234 contains the substring Blog.


#### Ensure you commit and push your changes at the end of the exam.
