# Assignment 1 specification.

## Overview.

__Objective:__ Demonstrate your knowledge of the React framework and ecosystem by designing and developing a SPA. The app may extend the Movies app developed in the labs (preference) or a bespoke app (subject to approval).

Completion: 29/04/2022.

Weight: 60%.

Deliverables:
A text file (assignment1.txt) containing:
+ The URL of your source code GitHub repo.
     + With a completed README.md (see provided template).
+ The URL of your YouTube video demonstrating your app.

We may follow up with a Zoom meeting for Q and A (if required).

##### The README is the documentation of the work you have carried out and must be complete and accurate. We will provide a template later.

##### You must maintain a detailed Git commit history throughout the assignment period. We advise that you commit at every development session - the 'only commit working code' principle need not always apply. Commit messages must always explain the purpose of each session, whether achieved or not.

## Grading spectrum.

### Good (40-60%).
Theme: Foundation skill set.

__Characteristics:__ The new features developed are similar in component structure, UI style and behaviour to those produced in the labs.

Features (All of the following):
+ UI.
    + Additional Data list pages, e.g. Top-rated movies, Similar movies, Actors, Movie cast, TV Series, etc.
    + Multi-criteria filtering and sorting.
+ Routing.
    + Mix of static and parameterized routes.
+ API integration.
    + ~4 new endpoints. 
    + Server state caching.
+ Storybook support (mew components).

### Excellent (60-80%).
Theme: Highly competent developer.

__Characteristics:__ In addition to 'listing' views/pages, the app also computes valuable information for the user. This custom behaviour also requires custom components and UI styling.
 
Features:
+ Computed information - Similar movies (by genre) OR Similar actors (by genre) *1
+ Multi-criteria Search. *2
+ Pagination - for 'data list' pages.    
+ Extensive data hyperlinking.
   + Multiple parameterized URLs.  
+ Storybook support.
+ Other (Discuss with the lecturer)

*1 - Similar movies: Find other movies with one or more genres in common with a given film. Limit the scope of the comparison (e.g. 60). Display the result in decreasing order of similarity.
Similar actors: For a given actor's filmography, compute the number of movies jn each genre. Then find other actors that have similar genre profiles. Limit the scope of the comparison (e.g. 60). Display the result in decreasing order of similarity.

*2 - Search for movies (actors) based on criteria submitted on a web form. The form should use appropriate controls - menus, checkbox, etc.

*3 - See react-query pagination support.

## Outstanding (80+)
Theme: Independent learner.

Characteristics: Can research and use techniques and technologies not covered in the labs/lectures.

Features:
+ Authentication.
    + A mixture of private and public pages/features.
+ TMDB Lists and Sessions.
+ Your movie (*1)
+ Other (Discuss with the lecturer)

*1 - The user can create their fantasy movie. Limit the details to : 
Title, Overview, Genres, Release Date, Runtime, Poster, and cast. After the initial record, the user adds the cast, perhaps using a tagging technique or another approach.
